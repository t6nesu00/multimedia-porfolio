		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>My name is SUMAN NEPALI. I have tried my best to complete this assignment. I used some youtube channels, class materials and some web materials as a refrence. Personally, I like the content of the assignment and it has covered lots of things and student are learning many things in a single assignment.</p>
		<h1>Easy Part</h1>
		<p>Well each and every parts of exercise are worthy in order to have better understanding. However to be an honest the first two task are comparatively easier than other. In first it need couple of line of JavaScript code which did not appear so tough for me. RWD pattern is new for me, but I learned so many things about me and to say fact I found it quite easy in implementation.</p>
		<h1>Hard Part</h1>
		<p>Well almost more than half part of the assignment were quite tough for me. Although we had some intoduction of JavaScript in previous year, still making a game and drawing application were really tough. On the other hand topic websocket and AJAX call was completely new for me.</p>
